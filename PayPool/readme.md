# PayPool Smart Contract

## Overview

`PayPool` is a Solidity smart contract designed to manage a pool of funds, allowing approved addresses to deposit tokens and granting allowances to specified users. The contract includes features for adding and removing deposit addresses, approving or rejecting deposits, and retrieving balances.

## Features

- Deposit tokens to the pool
- Manage deposit addresses
- Approve or reject deposits
- Retrieve funds from the pool
- Grant and remove allowances for users
- Allow users with allowances to retrieve their allocated funds

## Deployment

### Prerequisites

- Solidity compiler version ^0.8.25
- OpenZeppelin Contracts library for `ReentrancyGuard`

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install @openzeppelin/contracts
```

3. Compile the contract:

```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

## Contract Details

### State Variables

- `totalBalance`: Total balance of the pool
- `owner`: Owner of the contract
- `depositAddresses`: List of addresses allowed to deposit tokens
- `allowances`: Mapping of user addresses to their allowances
- `depositHistory`: Array of deposit records

### Structs

- `DepositRecord`: Contains `depositor` address, `amount` deposited, `timestamp` of deposit, and `status` (Pending, Approved, Rejected)

### Enums

- `DepositStatus`: Enum with values `Pending`, `Approved`, `Rejected`

### Events

- `Deposit`: Emitted when a deposit is made
- `AddressAdded`: Emitted when a deposit address is added
- `AddressRemoved`: Emitted when a deposit address is removed
- `AllowanceGranted`: Emitted when an allowance is granted
- `AllowanceRemoved`: Emitted when an allowance is removed
- `FundsRetrieved`: Emitted when funds are retrieved
- `DepositApproved`: Emitted when a deposit is approved
- `DepositRejected`: Emitted when a deposit is rejected

### Modifiers

- `isOwner`: Ensures the caller is the owner
- `gotAllowance`: Ensures the user has an allowance
- `canDepositTokens`: Ensures the depositor is allowed to deposit tokens

## Functions

### Constructor

```solidity
constructor() payable
```

Initializes the contract with the deploying address as the owner and sets the initial balance to the sent value.

### Internal Functions

- `hasAllowance(address user)`: Checks if a user has an allowance
- `canDeposit(address depositor)`: Checks if an address is allowed to deposit tokens

### External Functions

- `addDepositAddress(address depositor)`: Adds a new deposit address
- `removeDepositAddress(uint index)`: Removes a deposit address by index
- `deposit()`: Allows an approved address to deposit tokens
- `approveDeposit(uint256 index)`: Approves a deposit by index
- `rejectDeposit(uint256 index)`: Rejects a deposit by index
- `getDepositHistory()`: Returns the deposit history
- `retrieveBalance()`: Allows the owner to retrieve the total balance
- `giveAllowance(uint amount, address user)`: Grants an allowance to a user
- `removeAllowance(address user)`: Removes a user's allowance
- `allowRetrieval()`: Allows a user to retrieve their allowance

## Usage

1. Deploy the contract:

```javascript
const PayPool = await ethers.getContractFactory("PayPool");
const payPool = await PayPool.deploy();
await payPool.deployed();
console.log("PayPool deployed to:", payPool.address);
```

2. Add deposit addresses:

```javascript
await payPool.addDepositAddress(depositAddress);
```

3. Deposit tokens:

```javascript
await payPool.deposit({ value: ethers.utils.parseEther("1.0") });
```

4. Approve or reject deposits:

```javascript
await payPool.approveDeposit(depositIndex);
await payPool.rejectDeposit(depositIndex);
```

5. Retrieve balance:

```javascript
await payPool.retrieveBalance();
```

6. Grant and remove allowances:

```javascript
await payPool.giveAllowance(amount, userAddress);
await payPool.removeAllowance(userAddress);
```

7. Retrieve allowance:

```javascript
await payPool.allowRetrieval();
```
